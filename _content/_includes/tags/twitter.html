    I posted my first tweet March 19th, 2008 and have used it fairly consistently since then. 
    On February, 2021, 
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html">inspired by Cal Newport</a>, 
    I unfollowed everyone, downloaded an archive from the site, and deleted 9,920 tweets.

    The idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention 
    is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete, and it should be 
    to you if youâ€™re serious about creating things that matter.

    I publish new posts there as I have for over a decade and occasionally share articles.
    I don't log in at all anymore so if you want to comment on something I've written, you can
    post an <a href="https://github.com/joshcanhelp/josh-to-11/issues">Issue on GitHub</a> (even if you don't have an issue) or write me directly at
    <code>josh @ this domain</code>.
