## This is not an emergency


I've heard this both in parent coaching and in a [great article](https://medium.com/@konigsberg/patterns-and-anti-patterns-of-the-primary-interrupt-d82cc1362048) about being on-call for a web service: 

> And most important, please don’t rush. Real emergencies are life and death situations. This is not an emergency.

The point is: there are (thankfully) very few actual emergencies in life. Treating an email or stressed out kid or a deliverable as an emergency causes extra anxiety and lowers your ability to do a good job. *Take a breath.*



## One team,<br>One score,<br>Everywhere


I cribbed this from [Auth0's values](https://auth0.com/careers/culture) but it applies to much more than work:

> Team success always outweighs individual accomplishments, and we celebrate both.

I think about this in the context of my marriage (her accomplishments are mine and vice versa), our family (our kids' success is ours as well), our neighborhood, our school ... everywhere. Putting the success of the people around you at the same level as, or higher than,  your own pays dividends.



## Life is an unending series of complications 


This could be read as pessimistic but it's just an acknowledgement of how things actually are and how things must be. Everyday we face problems of varying magnitudes. From a ripped grocery bag handle to an unlucky financial event to a death of someone close to you. Lamenting problems that comes up is just unnecessary suffering.

## This too shall pass.<br>Let it.


A reminder that everything good and bad, hard and easy, uncomfortable and pleasurable, comes to an end. This is not a rephrasing of "life is short," it's a prompt to stay present through the good stuff and stay positive through the rest.



## Current habits === current results


This came from a great interview of James Clear by Sam Harris ([my notes here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/improvement-as-experimentation/#2020-11-24)). It's simple but something we often forget. Everything about our life, good or bad, is, at least in part, due to what we do in response to stimuli over and over. Basing changes in your life on "trying harder" is not a strategy.



## Observe the thought and let it pass.<br>Where does it go?


This will make more sense to those who have experience in meditation but take a minute to ask yourself: what is a thought? When you are lost in thought, what is that experience? What are you aware of during that time?

For me, thoughts are still pictures combined with words, typically in my voice. This slideshow can be mesmorizing but I can also become aware of it, see it for what it is (images and words), and it kind of just .... melts away. This is my reminder that this exercise is possible.



## Begin again,<br>in this moment


No matter what you're doing or where you are mentally, you can start over right now. You can put the phone down and plug in. You can pick that project back up. You can re-commit to what you're doing right now, even if you've been distracted for the last 5, 10, or 30 minutes. Regardless of how much time you have left, regardless of how much time you spent distracted. 

Apply the [sunk cost fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tyMdPwd8x2RygcheE/sunk-cost-fallacy) to time and don't let poor past performance ruin what's possible next.



## There is no such thing as free will


Everything you think and do is a product of countless external influences, the condition of your experience at the time, and a life of experiences leading up to this moment. This moment is the effect of myriad causes outside of your control. How is it possible to look back and regret anything?

[Here's an essay that goes into more detail about this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/).



## Drop back and notice what you notice


What are the contents of your experience right now? What are you aware of in this moment? Sounds, sensations in your body, thoughts, and your visual field are all part of your consciousness in this moment. Spend a few moments becoming aware of everything that is happening there. 



## Boredom is a lack of attention


The next time you're bored, pay attention to that feeling. What is happening in your body and mind when you're bored? I find that it's often when I'm doing one thing but want to do another and can't. Or maybe I keep doing something (scrolling through Twitter, for instance) because I'm avoiding thoughts about something else.

Become present for a moment and examine your experience.



## This might be the last time


This is less about death and more about realizing that everything you do with your kids has a last time. There is a last time that they will ask you to push them on a swing. A last time they want to ride on your shoulders. A last time they'll imagine something and draw it. A last time you'll ever read out loud to them. And you'll never know it's the last time while you're doing it.

Being aware of this is a powerful way to stay present and give yourself to these moments that will, undoubtedly, feel precious looking back.



## The kids are never wrong


I think I read this in Astrid the Unstoppable but, wherever it was, it rang clear and true. How could a child be wrong about how they feel? How could they be wrong in sharing their experience? It's easy to fall into the trap of gaslighting your kids, protecting your ego at their expense.



## Get to kindness


The worst decisions in life are made and executed while angry, particularly parenting decisions. I take away screen time and then realize I shot myself in the foot when it's time to cook dinner. 

The best decisions are made when I can take my emotions out of it. I show kindness when my kids are acting out and they pay that kindness forward later that day.



## We don’t have to take responsibility for how they feel



## Solve problems together



## Let them help



## Stand up for a bit



## Drink a glass of water



## Go for a walk



## Stretch your back, legs, hips



## Ruthlessly prioritize


I'm a maniacal list maker. It's something I have to mitigate and keep under control regularly. The issue comes when its time to get a single thing done (the only number of things that can be done at one time) and I see the list of everything else.

What is the most important thing to get done today? What's the second? Great, that's the list for the day. Move everything else into a backlog that's hidden until the first two are done.
