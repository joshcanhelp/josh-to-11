This collection of sites and resources is a great example why I would subscribe to a printed version of this website.

## [The Most Popular Photoshop Tutorials of all Time](http://psd.fanextra.com/articles/the-most-popular-photoshop-tutorials-of-all-time/)

There are an unbelievable about of Photoshop (and Illustrator and web design and…) tutorial sites and posts out there that it’s hard to keep up with them all. Well, I can’t either so I don’t. I realized recently that, unless you have tons of extra time to walk through these and nothing better to do, you should look for a tutorial that helps you with the project you’re working on. How does this relate to web strategy? Part of a cogent presence online is how, visually, it represents you. Pick up a few ideas or try your hand at Photoshop… it can’t hurt.

These kinds of posts are in a sense timeless, and have inspired countless designers (including myself) to begin writing their own tutorials.

## [10 Must Track Google Analytics Goals](https://www.webanalyticsworld.net/2009/03/10-must-track-google-analytics-goals.html)

I’ve been getting deeper and deeper in to website analytics and having a lot of fun playing around with data and trying to come up with coherent and **useful** conclusions. I was once told “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” (a Peter Drucker quote). That may not be the best advice for every situation but, for web analytics, it holds true. The more you understand about how people come to your site and interact with what you’re offering, the better you can serve them.
