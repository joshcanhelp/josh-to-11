**For as long as I can remember, I've struggled with repetitive, mostly-negative thinking.** This could be distracting for a few minutes, part of a day, or it could stretch into days at a time. I found some relief through exercise but it was temporary and I would find it hard to get over the hump. 

During these times by mind would feel like a tornado of self-talk. Endless conversations with myself, picking apart choices I've made and things I've said, where I could have done better. It also manifested as constant lists of things to do, amounting to more work than I could do in a year. Irrationally, I would also stress out about how much there was to get done despite that.

**It always felt somewhat productive, like this is how one improves.** If I wasn't finding flaws in every little thing I did, how would I grow as a husband and a dad? Or as an engineer? If I didn't find all the things to do and put them on a list, how would they get done? 

This feeling has always been there, underlying everything I do. But when things get bad, it's so "loud" that I kind of turn in on myself. Screen time tracking and IPA consumption on my phone goes up, focus at work and patience with everything around me goes down. 

I've called this feeling "being depressed" for a long time but I'm beginning to see that it's much more like general anxiety. Regardless of what it is, it's been a constant in my life. 

**I've tried a number of things to break free of this persistant condition.** Exercise has provided some relief in the moment but that relief never lasted and it's hard to do when you're in the think of it. I've been to therapy a few times but never found a good fit. I've even tried meditation and mindfulness before but it never seemed to stick. 

I was caught between wondering if this is just something I have to suffer through and feeling like I would do anything to get rid of it. 

Last September, I found a meditation app called [Waking Up](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/redeemMonth/fa5bb0) through a random series of events. I downloaded it, started the 28 day introduction (10 minutes per day) and, within that time, slowly realized that this was the relief I had been looking for all along. 

My mindfulness "practice" before, if you could call it that, has consisted of a number of failry misguided practices that would only be a part of my life for a handful of occurances before being being forgotten. I tried listening to "sound bath" music [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPV3pbe9JLY) and either trying desparately to clear my mind for a half an hour or just following each thought thread intensionally. Clearing your mind forecully of all thoughts is impossible and quite uncomfortable while just folloing your thoughts where they lead is the opposite of being mindful. I also tried a different meditation app that concentrated on "body scanning" type meditation. I found the practice hokey and an unspiring way to spend 30 minutes every day. I also tried just "being present" intensionally and that, well, give it a try and you'll see what it's like. 

**But all of these activities required me to use my willpower to do something with my mind.** This kind of "just do it" mentality around mental (and physical) health has never been a path to lasting change for me. I could never really want the outcome enough to suffer through the journey for very long. In the case of mindfulness, it was made even harder because I wasn't sure what the outcome was. A general feeling of well-being? More productive and focused? I knew what I wanted to be free of but there was no guarantee that the practice would get me there. 

****I needed an idea where I was going and guidance around the specific things my mind was naturally doing to thwart focus.**** I had an instinct that mindfulness, in general, was what I needed and meditation was probably what would get me there. **It turns out, what I needed was a coach and that's what I got from Waking Up.**

I talk mainly about the meditation practice below but part of what got me using the app more and more was the first few hours of content in the Theory section of the app. Here are two that were particularly insightful to me:

- [The Logic of Practice](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/1d74ed)
- [Begin Again](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/66315d)

I want to be careful not to sell Waking Up to you. While I recommend it fully and have been trying to get almost everyone I know to try it, the thing I'm actually trying to sell you on is mindfulness, generally, and a meditation practice specifically. The Waking Up app just happened to be the thing that helped me see the proverbial light through a number of important break-throughs.

**The first major break-through for me was seeing thoughts for what they are: appearances in consciousness.** Just like a sound or a sight or a smell, you become aware of thoughts as they appear. We've all had the experience where we were reading a book and, at the end of the paragraph, realize that we were thinking about something else and have no recollection of what that paragraph was about. That's the feeling of your awareness switching from your vision, processing symbols into language, to your thought. 

During meditation, the same thing happens. You're focusing on your breathing, following your chest going up and down, and then suddenly you're off somewhere else making a grocery list or planning out your work day. It's expected and, when it does and you realize it, you learn to become aware of the thought and examine it. 

**It turns out that thoughts, while often mesmerizing, consist of components that can be examined.** For me, thoughts are typically a few images combined with A LOT of words. I found that I could describe to myself that thought, the exact images and words that were coming through, like I could with any other thing that I experience. I walk back through the images I saw and conjure up the words I heard as a way to become aware of the thought. What I found, quite quickly, is that the thought itself dissolves, replaced by your meta-thinking about that thought. Now you're examining what's going on in your mind instead of just following the thought. 

If you have not tried any formal meditation practice of this type, the last 3 paragraphs might be completely baffling to you. I would have had this same experience before starting my practice and that's to be expected. It's not common for people to examine how their mind functions in this way without being clued into the fact that it's possible. 

Practicing this act of beginning again, of looking at your thoughts directly instead of just following the thoughts themselves is truly the point of a meditation practice. You might start a 10 minute session and find yourself coming back to your breath over and over and over and think "this is insane, my mind is not made for this." But one of those times you might listen to Sam say something like ...

> If you find yourself lost in thought, become aware of the thought itself. Observe the thought and then let it pass. Where does it go?

... and give it a try. Just once in the whole ten minutes. And you might find that you too can "see" what that thought consisted of, what images you brought forth and what words you were saying to yourself. You might be able to recreate a whole part of that thought, almost exactly how it played out in your mind. 

That's how it all started for me, these little acts of observation, a few seconds during each session that started adding up. It starts to become clear that this cycle of being unconsciously pulled into thinking, realizing that you're there (quite literally waking up), looking around as though you just became lucid in a dream, and then coming back to your practice is, in fact, the practice. You learn that **the more you walk through this process, the more effective your practice is.** The exact thing that I was beating myself up for previously, thinking and then having to return, was exactly what I was supposed to be doing without realizing it. 

That was another important break-through for me, that meditation is not about discovering some state and then training yourself to achieve that state over and over again. I found, in the beinning, that sitting there without thinking is a strange experience. Without some kind of distraction, it felt like my mind was a little rabbit in the forest and there were thoughts at every turn, threatening to pounce at any moment. I would find this "state" of not thinking and try to hold on to it desperately, my brain white-knuckled with effort. This effort would always come with a fresh wave of shame or another negative feeling, that all-too-familiar message of "you're doing this wrong ... again."

I have since learned to recognize that feeling and realize that, in those moments, I'm doing something far more difficult than just recognizing what I'm thinking about. I take a big breath and just let the thoughts come, examining each one as it appears. It might take a minute to get back to what I was meditating on but I now know that the time was not wasted. What initially felt like a state of mind that required great effort to maintain for an arduous 10 minutes now feels like the true, natural starting point of your mind, the root of your whole experience. 

**The observance of thoughts for what they are and the growing familiarity with this place of rest within my mind amounted to a strong curiosity of how my mind works.** It took over 4 decades to finally see how my mind was functioning in every moment. I was not changing anything, I was seeing clearly the mechanics and it was, without hyoerbole, a revelation. All this time I had been trying to force myself to think a certain way or stop feeling a certain thing without understanding what a thought was or how I was experiencing a feeling. The freedom I was hoping for was not found in control, it was found in knowledge. 

This growing curiosity immediately became the motivation to continue my practice. [I have explored my motivation for positive personal change before](/improvement-as-experimentation/) and knew for that outcomes have never been enough to push me through a boring and repetitive practice. If I was going to do something, I had to enjoy some part of the process. The enjoyment of meditation began to come from the discoveries and connections that I was finding on a regular basis. If I started to find a particular meditation session boring, it would become clear to me that I wasn't paying attention to the practice itself. Beginning again and recommitting to what I was doing for a measly 6 more minutes was an easy choice to make. 

While I was exploring the inner workings of my mind for 10-20 minutes per day, I was also seeing the effects of this shift in my "regular" life outside of the practice. 
 

- Key point: becoming curious
    - It was not straining or boring to meditate
    - I was able to drop back during emotional times and observe rather than getting lost in thought
    - I was seeing up close how my mind works
- Once those initial obstacles could be overcome regularly, learning progressed
    - Challenging the idea of free will 
        - If you don't create your own thoughts then your focus, or lack thereof, is not your "fault"
    - Boredom is a lack of attention
    - Challenging the idea of self
    - Everything is appearing in consciousness
