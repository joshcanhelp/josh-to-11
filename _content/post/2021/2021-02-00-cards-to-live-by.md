One day last November, I tried to come up with a morning ritual I could stick to. Nothing crazy, just a handful of things I wanted to do each day like drink a big glass of water, stretch, meditate, take vitamins, etc. One of the things on that list was to review a list of phrases I wanted to keep in mind throughout the day.

I would read each card, let it sit with me for a few seconds, put a little dot on it if it resonated and then move onto the next. It ended up being an important mental exercise during the isolated, cold, and drenched holiday season. I would find myself just running through them as one more thing to get through, then pause, remember why I'm spending the time, and start over. When parenting or meditating or just trying to exist in a weird and scary time, one of these phrases would often bubble up and provide some calm. 

In the hopes of inspiring someone else to do the same, I thought I'd share the phrases here, along with where they came from and what they mean to me. 

## First principles

Phrases that apply to everything

#### This is not an emergency

I've heard this in a few contexts, both in parent coaching and in a [great article](https://medium.com/@konigsberg/patterns-and-anti-patterns-of-the-primary-interrupt-d82cc1362048) about being on-call for a web service: 

> And most important, please don’t rush. Real emergencies are life and death situations. This is not an emergency.

The point is: there are (thankfully) very few actual emergencies in life. Treating an email or stressed out kid or a deliverable as an emergency causes extra anxiety and lowers your ability to do a good job. *Take a breath.*

#### One team, One score, Everywhere

I cribbed this from [Auth0's values](https://auth0.com/careers/culture) but it applies to much more than work:

> Team success always outweighs individual accomplishments, and we celebrate both.
> Contribute beyond your own area of responsibility when you can.

I think about this in the context of my marriage (her accomplishments are mine and vice versa), our family (our kids' success is ours as well), our neighborhood, our school ... everywhere. Putting the success of the people around you at the same level as, or higher than,  your own pays dividends.

#### Life is an unending series of complications 

This could be read as pessimistic but it's just an acknowledgement of how things actually are and how things must be

#### This too shall pass. Let it.

A reminder that everything good and bad, hard and easy, uncomfortable and pleasurable, comes to an end. This is not a rephrasing of "life is short," it's an reminder to stay present through the good stuff and stay positive through the rest. 

#### Current habits === current results

This came from a great interview of James Clear by Sam Harris ([my notes here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/improvement-as-experimentation/#2020-11-24)). 

## Mindfulness

#### Observe the thought and let it pass. Where does it go?
#### Begin again, in this moment
#### There is no such thing as free will
#### Practice without struggle or strain
#### Drop back and notice what you notice
#### Boredom is a lack of attention

## Parenting

#### This might be the last time
#### The kids are never wrong
#### Get to kindness
#### We don’t have to take responsibility for how they feel
#### Solve problems together
#### Let them help

## Body

#### Stand up for a bit
#### Drink a glass of water
#### Go for a walk
#### Stretch your back, legs, hips

## Professional

#### Ruthlessly prioritize

What is the most important thing to get done today? What's the second? Great, your list for the day is done! Move everything else into a backlog that you don't look at until these two are done.

I'm a maniacal list maker. I don't say this to brag as it's something I have to mitigate and keep under control. The problem with lists is it's quite easy to overwhelm yourself.
