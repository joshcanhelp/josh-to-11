One day last November, I tried to build a morning ritual I could stick to. Nothing crazy, just a handful of things I wanted to do each day like drink a big glass of water, stretch, meditate, take vitamins, acting like an adult. One of the things on that list was to review a list of phrases I wanted to keep in mind throughout the day. 

![Index cards with mantras](/_images/2021/02/cards_to_live_by.jpg)

I would read each card, let it sit with me for a few seconds, put a little dot on it if it resonated and then move onto the next. 

It ended up being an important mental exercise during the isolated, cold, and wet holiday season. I would find myself just running through them as one more thing to get through, then pause, remember why I'm spending the time, and start over. When parenting or meditating or just trying to exist in the world during an uncertain time, one of these phrases would often bubble up and provide some calm. 

In the hopes of inspiring someone else to do the same, I thought I'd share the phrases here, along with where they came from and what they mean to me. 

## First principles

Phrases that apply to mostly everything.

#### This is not an emergency

I've heard this in a few contexts, both in parent coaching and in a [great article](https://medium.com/@konigsberg/patterns-and-anti-patterns-of-the-primary-interrupt-d82cc1362048) about being on-call for a web service: 

> And most important, please don’t rush. Real emergencies are life and death situations. This is not an emergency.

The point is: there are (thankfully) very few actual emergencies in life. Treating an email or stressed out kid or a deliverable as an emergency causes extra anxiety and lowers your ability to do a good job. *Take a breath.*

#### One team, One score, Everywhere

I cribbed this from [Auth0's values](https://auth0.com/careers/culture) but it applies to much more than work:

> Team success always outweighs individual accomplishments, and we celebrate both.
> Contribute beyond your own area of responsibility when you can.

I think about this in the context of my marriage (her accomplishments are mine and vice versa), our family (our kids' success is ours as well), our neighborhood, our school ... everywhere. Putting the success of the people around you at the same level as, or higher than,  your own pays dividends.

#### Life is an unending series of complications 

This could be read as pessimistic but it's just an acknowledgement of how things actually are and how things must be. Everyday we face problems of varying magnitudes. From a ripped grocery bag handle to an unlucky financial event to a death of someone close to you. Lamenting problems that comes up is just unnecessary suffering.

[Here is Sam Harris with a brief audio clip](https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/videos/learn-to-embrace-lifes-complications/617808915751783/).

#### This too shall pass. Let it.

A reminder that everything good and bad, hard and easy, uncomfortable and pleasurable, comes to an end. This is not a rephrasing of "life is short," it's a prompt to stay present through the good stuff and stay positive through the rest.

#### Current habits === current results

This came from a great interview of James Clear by Sam Harris ([my notes here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/improvement-as-experimentation/#2020-11-24)). It's simple but something we often forget. Everything about our life, good or bad, is, at least in part, due to what we do in response to stimuli over and over. Basing changes in your life on "trying harder" is not a strategy.

## Mindfulness

Words related to meditation and mindfulness in general.

#### Observe the thought and let it pass. Where does it go?

This will make more sense to those who have experience in meditation but take a minute to ask yourself: what is a thought? When you are lost in thought, what is that experience? What are you aware of during that time? 

![Meditating snowman](/_images/2021/02/meditating-snowman.jpg)

For me, thoughts are still pictures combined with words, typically in my voice. This slideshow can be mesmorizing but I can also become aware of it, see it for what it is (images and words), and it kind of just .... melts away. This is my reminder that this exercise is possible.

#### Begin again, in this moment

No matter what you're doing or where you are mentally, you can start over right now. You can put the phone down and plug in. You can pick that project back up. You can re-commit to what you're doing right now, even if you've been distracted for the last 5, 10, or 30 minutes. Regardless of how much time you have left, regardless of how much time you spent distracted. 

Apply the [sunk cost fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tyMdPwd8x2RygcheE/sunk-cost-fallacy) to time and don't let poor past performance ruin what's possible next.

#### There is no such thing as free will

This is another one that might be difficult to approach without some experience in mindfulness but give it a try. Take a second to think of a place in the world, anywhere. 

Got one?

Now, why did you pick that place? Of all the places in the world that you know of, what led you to pick that exact one? Were you deciding between 2 of them and landed on one? Think about the process that you to choose that one place. 

The point of this exercise is to realize that everything you think and do is a product of countless external influences, the condition of your experience at the time, and a life of experiences leading up to this moment. This moment is the effect of countless causes. If you have free will, why don't you make the best choice in every situation? How is it possible to look back and regret anything?

[Here's an essay that goes into more detail about this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/).

#### Drop back and notice what you notice

What are the contents of your experience right now? What are you aware of in this moment? Sounds, sensations in your body, thoughts, and your visual field are all part of your consciousness in this moment. Spend a few moments becoming aware of everything that is happening there. 

#### Boredom is a lack of attention

Boredom can be an uncomfortable experience, and there has been a lot if it during this peroid of isolation. It's even worse when you have young kids at home. They have a tendency to bore you with their boredom and often the only cure at hand is yet another game or puzzle or imaginative scenario. 

But the next time you're bored, pay attention to that feeling. What is happening in your body and mind when you're bored? I find that it's often when I'm doing one thing but want to do another and can't. Or maybe I keep doing something (scrolling through Twitter, for instance) because I'm avoiding thoughts about something else.

Become present for a moment and examine your experience.

## Parenting

Maybe you don't have kids and you're asking yourself "why does this guy need a reminder to be kind" or maybe you just have a completely different parenting experience. Either way, this section is my most vulnerable.

#### This might be the last time

This is less about death and more about realizing that everything you do with your kids has a last time. There is a last time that they will ask you to push them on a swing. A last time they want to ride on your shoulders. A last time they'll imagine something and draw it. A last time you'll ever read out loud to them. And you'll never know it's the last time while you're doing it.

Being aware of this is a powerful way to stay present and give yourself to these moments that will, undoubtedly, feel precious looking back.

#### The kids are never wrong
#### Get to kindness
#### We don’t have to take responsibility for how they feel
#### Solve problems together
#### Let them help

## Body

#### Stand up for a bit
#### Drink a glass of water
#### Go for a walk
#### Stretch your back, legs, hips

## Professional

#### Ruthlessly prioritize

What is the most important thing to get done today? What's the second? Great, your list for the day is done! Move everything else into a backlog that you don't look at until these two are done.

I'm a maniacal list maker. I don't say this to brag as it's something I have to mitigate and keep under control. The problem with lists is it's quite easy to overwhelm yourself.
