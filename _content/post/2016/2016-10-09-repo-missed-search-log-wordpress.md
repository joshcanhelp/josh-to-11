This was a customer feature that I open-sourced for anyone to use. A client of mine wanted to know what potential customers were searching on the site that would end up with no results.

Together, we created this plugin to track all search queries that returned no results on the site. Using this data, they were able to add new vendors and products based on what existing site visitors wanted.
