- 9 oz cacao nibs
- 16 oz Dermerara sugar
- 0.5 tsp salt

**Steps:**

1. Toast the cacao nibs in a 350-degree F oven until aromatic, about 5 minutes, taking care not to burn. 
2. Combine the hot cacao nibs with the rum in a zip-close plastic bag and place in a large bowl. 
3. Submerge the bag in boiling water and let it soak until the water comes to room temperature.
4. Using a chinois or a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth, strain the infused rum into a large bowl. Discard the solids. 
5. Add the sugar and salt, then stir until fully dissolved. 
6. Pour into a jar or other airtight container, seal and store at room temperature.
