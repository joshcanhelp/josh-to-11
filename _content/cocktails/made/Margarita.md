This is the best margarita you'll have. If you've mostly had ones in Mexican restaurants, be ready for a whole different experience here. The agave + fresh lime makes you wonder if the two should have different names altogether. It works over ice or up and you can substitute fruit liqueurs for some or all of the sweetness (Cointreau, Midori, etc).

* 2 oz [[Tequila]] or [[Mezcal]]
* 1 oz lime juice
* 0.5oz agave or simple syrup
* Pinch of salt

**Steps:**

Shake and serve up or over fresh ice
