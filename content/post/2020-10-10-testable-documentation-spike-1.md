The "code only" option here is not introducing any new tools but writing our code samples in a way that we could solve the rot. There are a number of examples out there to draw inspiration from:

- The Auth0 Express OIDC library has [runnable examples for a number of use cases](https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect/tree/master/examples)
- We also have a number of runnable sample applications ([here's one in Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-rubyonrails-sample/tree/master/01-Login)) that serve as compliments to [a Quickstart tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails)
- My [WordPress Unit Testing post](/wordpress-unit-testing-techniques/) uses a [functional, linted GitHub repo](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/wp-test-plugin)

All of the examples above are lintable and runnable
 code but they fall short in different ways. Still, we can use them as a model for "code only" exmaples.
