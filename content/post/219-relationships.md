I find interpersonal relationships **fascinating**.

3 Parts to Every Person
-----------------------

The way in which we relate to people can be broken down into 3 parts.

### Core Self

This is the part of me that defines, as steadfastly or flexibly as I decide, the things I truly believe in. This incorporates my religion, my views on society, my political leanings, and how I see the world as a whole. This also comprises my fears, my aspirations, my goals, and my true priorities in life. It’s the true “me,” the actual person that I am and the model that decides how I act.

This “core” or “true self” can be as opaque or transparent as we wish it to be. If you’re the type of person that thinks about how and why you behave, to a fault or otherwise, this entity is more transparent. If, instead, you’re more deterministic or externally-focused, this part of yourself is more opaque. There is a lot of focus, currently, on discovering who you really are, finding and examining this person that guides you through life. I don’t believe that this discovery, or the pursuit thereof, makes you a better or worse person but I’ll get to that later.

When you start thinking about different people and different core selves, you can start to get a relative concept of size. If I have a “large” core self, that means I have a lot of built-in guides that determine what I’m likely to do or not do in a certain situation. This can make my decision-making process fairly easy in most situations. For example, if I identify as a straight, Christian, married woman who is scared of heights and spiders then I’m unlikely to go on a date with someone who is not my husband, particularly not another woman, to visit and arachnid exhibit on the 100th floor of a mosque. While this situation is unlikely to present itself to most people, you can see how this core system makes my decision making easier and easier the larger my set of beliefs get.

You can see, though, that my decisions are easier to make but my worldview is limited. If I’m extremely fervent in my religious convictions, I might miss out on see some of the most beautiful architecture in the world by being unwilling to expand beyond what I hold true. I might miss out on meeting a good friend because of my disdain for their lifestyle. I might lose out on significant life experiences because of my deep-rooted fears. A “large” core self might help reduce anxiety but it can also reduce life experience; whether that’s a good or bad thing is a judgement call and, to tie it all together, part of your core self.

### Portrayed Self

My core self is who I *actually* am and what I *actually* believe but there is another component of the self that plays heavily into my relationships: who I portray myself to be.

My portrayed self is the self I show to the world. This is what I talk about with strangers and what I write in short, online bios. This is my Instagram feed and my resume and my blog posts and what I say and don’t say to people. This portrayed self is the curated bits of information that we share in order to create an image of the person we want people to know us as.

This “alternate” self is overlapped almost perfectly with the core self for some people. These people are predictable and transparent (with no negative connotation implied for either) and, likely, easier to get to know. For others, this portrayed self is an entirely different person, a carefully-crafted fiction used to maintain distance, self-protect, or achieve specific goals.

Based on this, it would be easy to say that people with a portrayed self that closely matches their core self are simply “better” but I don’t believe that to be the case. If my core self is fearful and pessimistic and close-minded but I portray myself as carefree and positive and flexible, not only will I find myself around those types of people more often (“like attracts like” is a powerful force, in my experience), I’ll be able to break out of the confines of what my core self “allows.” On the flip side, if I’m the same fearful and pessimistic and close-minded person and show that to the world, positive relationships with but the most negative people will be difficult.

Excepting the case of mindful, intensional deception, I believe a shifted portrayed self can be a powerful tool for self-improvement. I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase “act as if” when describing the path to change. If I act as if I am someone that I’m not, it’s easy to start becoming that person. Maybe I’m a deeply fearful person with low self-confidence. If I act like a person without fear and without those internal hangups, I will be perceived and treated like this “fiction,” likely leading me to continue to do so.

I also see a “size” component coming into play here, similar to the way it does with the core self. I might have a massive belief system internally but don’t want to share that with the world so my portrayed self is “smaller.” I also might be unlikely to share much about myself for any number of different reasons, also leading to a “smaller” self that others are allowed to see.
