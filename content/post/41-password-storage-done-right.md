It took me long enough but I’m finally implementing a password safe. I have so many sites, so many on-line apps, and so many computers that I think I’m just being silly by not using one of these. I’m choosing KeePass based on a [few recommendations](http://lifehacker.com/5052582/best-of-the-best-the-hive-five-winners). It can be downloaded from [their homepage](http://keepass.info/). A quick description:

> KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).

[KeePass Plugins](http://lifehacker.com/5046988/eight-best-keepass-plug+ins-to-master-your-passwords): Lifehacker covers a few useful plugins for KeePass. The two that I’m using are below.

[Export passwords to FF](http://www.mccreath.org.uk/Article/ClockWork-FireFox-to-KeePass-Converter_8.aspx): Make sure to download and install both pieces for this to work. It essentially creates an XML file with all of your Firefox passwords. I found it a bit scary that this can be made so easily. Even scarier is that ALL of your passwords can be seen in Firefox under Tools &gt; Options &gt; Security &gt; Saved Passwords. Still want them saved in Firefox? I didn’t think so…

KeeForm plugin (http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=19403) : this plugin allows you to open websites from the KeePass interface. It only opens in Internet Explorer though which is slightly odd.

That’s all for now. I’ll let you know if I learn more fun stuff about it!

**Note:** I’m using Dropbox to keep my password database synced to my home computer but it keeps syncing this lock file over and over and showing me a pop-up after it completes. I need to figure out why it’s doing this and fix it.
