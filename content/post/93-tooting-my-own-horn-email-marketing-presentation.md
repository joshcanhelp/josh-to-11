I just recently gave an hour long talk on email marketing titled “6 Questions to Ask Before Sending an Email Campaign.” This was based on two blog posts I made recently. The posts actually came from the presentation preparation so I got to hype them a bit during the talk. I thought I’d toot my own horn a bit and post the feedback that I got.

I felt good about it because I felt like I had everyone’s attention. I really wanted to add some value to these folks and introduce them to a few things they had never seen or heard about. I was speaking to college admissions professionals which, for the most part, are expected to be jacks of all trades. Great questions were thrown out there and I was pulled aside a few times before and after by audience members which means I sparked something.

Anyways, the proof is in the pudding:

And the comments:

> - This was excellent! Lots of great ideas, very concise information.
> - Wow! Lots of great info (and thank you for so many outside sources that we can check out later)! I have a lot to learn.
> - Great information, clearly communicated. Josh did a great job.
> - Even after \[bulk emailing software\] webinar a lot of useful information and good resources. Informative but humorous- great job!
> - Very useful for thinking about ways to make email marketing fit your needs for different purposes and how to best customize.
> - A lot of good ideas.
> - Would have been nice to see examples of good emails vs. ones that get spammed, landing pages that work with emails (live).
> - This is so great! I’ve got tons of new ideas for our campaigns.
> - Good as an overall look at email marketing, but would’ve been nice to be a little more \[product\] specific.
> - Interesting content. Presented well. Could have been enhanced by including examples of the six questions (i.e. Good and bad examples).
> - Great presenters, good info.
> - Updated/learned good information.

I provided a hand-out that summarized what I covered during the presentation which is basically a summary of my two blog posts. Feel free to download it and spread it around!
