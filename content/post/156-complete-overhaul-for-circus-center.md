# Complete Overhaul for Circus Center

The Circus Center came to me with an urgent redesign to coincide with an upcoming Groupon offer they were running. The site looked old and had a number of repeated pages, old information, and a difficult navigation system. It was an aggressive time frame but we got the site designed, approved, and built with a day to spare. The offer went very well and the staff is now trained to make changes and updates when they need to.
