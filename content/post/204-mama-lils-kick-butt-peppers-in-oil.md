In another life, I worked at a restaurant that served great Italian/Croatian food to people that were, on the whole, fairly pleasant. It was not a great job but it did have it’s benefits, like all the fresh-baked rolls you could sneak into your mouth while the manager wasn’t looking.

One of their specialties was stone-oven baked pizzas with a creative combination of toppings. There was a suite of regular items on the menu and a revolving one that was hit-or-miss. One day, one of these revolving flavors included the life-changing ingredient we have here, **Mama Lil’s Peppers**. It was love at first … taste. You thought I was going to say “bite,” didn’t you?

Ever since that moment so many years ago, I’ve been adding these sweet and hot little things to almost everything I eat that isn’t dessert (note to self). Pizza, sandwiches (tuna melts in particular, I don’t know why it works but it does), pasta, pizza, salads, steak, pizza – you name something eaten for dinner and I’ve considered whether Mama Lil’s can make it better.

I was very happy to see these peppers for sale online. Sure, you have to order by the flat but, take my word for it, these things not only keep well but they go **fast**. Plus, the oil you’re left with at the end can be used just as creatively drizzled over a panini or slathered over some warm, crusty bread. There’s no way you can go wrong here.
