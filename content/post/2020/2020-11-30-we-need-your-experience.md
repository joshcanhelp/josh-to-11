*I’m beginner, I’m intermediate, and I’m advanced.*   
*I’m an expert and a novice.*  
*I’m a teacher and a student.*

Can these things exist all at once? They can and we’re all proof of it.

I’ve been thinking about experience a lot while I’ve been taking a long, hard look at my professional life. I’ve become open to all opportunities, talking to people as much as possible to see what feels good, what fits who I am now, what fits who I see myself being in the future.

As such, I’ve had to do a lot of reading, writing about, and review of my professional history, my current skill set, and where I want to go. I’ve spent many hours writing about [my work](/work/), something I find both fun and difficult. I’ve also been getting my resume in shape since it’s been 3 years since I touched it and, even then, it was woefully incomplete. On top of that, I’ve been reaching out to people to meet and talk, whether I though something tangible would come out of it or not.

All of this activity has made me more informed about what I’ve done and what I think I’m capable of than I have been in a long time. **This can be a very dangerous place to be for some.**
