# Dynamic newsletter builder for collaborative blog

This newsletter builder started out as a Google Docs spreadsheet feeding into a custom script that built a valid HTML email template that worked great in popular email clients. Slowly, it evolved to use post information published by the main website (using Drupal) in a JSON format, eliminating the need to manually update the template every week. The template was built on-demand each time the page was loaded and the source could be viewed, copied, and pasted into our email marketing application, MailChimp. This saved an immense amount of time and made sure the most current content was being sent out.
