Once again, here are my Friday web strategy links. Lots going on right now and more to report soon but here are a few resources I found particularly relevant to me and what I do.

For the record, his advice rings true for businesses if you replace “give” with “buy.”

> The three keys to non-profit success, in my opinion, are: 1. Have a compelling story to tell. 2. Make a specific ask or establish a specific goal to reach. 3. Make it astonishingly easy to give.

CSS sprites help your page load much faster by only accessing a single image (like the Google one above) instead of many.
