There is nothing better for search results, returning visitors, and web loyalty than a useful and oft-updated blog feed. Some people aren’t familiar with blogs and what they can do so here’s a quick run-down.

A blog, in it’s simplest form, is just a feed of information in chronological order (the feed itself is call an RSS feed). It can be a personal journal, a list of work completed, an article distribution service, a book in parts, a photography collection, a news source, or anything else that would benefit from constant, up-to-date information.

A great business blog is updated regularly (daily, twice a week, twice a month), provides timely, relevant, useful, and unique information, and relates directly to the company or individual producing it. As an example, my blog is where I collect information about what I do, who I help, and thoughts about my industry and clients. It keeps my up-to-date on what I do and gives me a sense of reputation when people come to the site. It’s also great search engine fodder because Google, Yahoo, and the like look for sites that are updated regularly.

Blog posts can be short or long, include images or not, and be written by one person or a team of people. All you have to keep in mind is this:

- Make sure that the blog has a voice and a reason for being. It might take a few months to find your voice right but the reason for being should be front and center.
- Always think “can I blog this?” Stop sending out links and articles; rather, point your colleagues towards you blog and post them there. Make it the voice of your buisness.
- You don’t have to post everyday but make sure you’re somewhat consistent. Best-case scenario, your posts go out on the same day each week. If not, at least commit to a weekly number of updates.
