My long relationship with technology started in my early teen years posting on BBSes and building my own computers. After more than a decade of tinkering, I decided to make it my profession by building my first web site for a family member in 2006. Soon after that, I started taking on small client projects found via word-of-mouth and online-networking while completing a B.S. in Chemistry. Since then, I’ve built Josh Can Help up to a thriving freelance practice that’s been supporting me and my family since 2008.

I’ve worked with and for companies and agencies both large and small, including:

- **[Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/authors/josh-cunningham/)**
- Precision Nutrition
- Seattle Children’s Hospital
- 8ninths
- 10up
- SmartVault
- Alan Colmes
- CenturyLink
- Coca-Cola
- Pepsi
- Edelman
- AARP
- AT&amp;T Wireless
- Johnson &amp; Johnson
- The Fearey Group
- Monster Design
- SeaMonster Studios
- Hugo House
- Social Media Today
- Ready For Zero
- Ray’s Restaurant

I truly enjoy working on and with the web and I’ve met so many interesting, talented people along the way. I believe that you’re only as good as the people you associate with so I try to stay connected to people who I admire and enjoy spending time with. I also love helping people do their best online and elsewhere, hence the name of this site and my online persona.

More?

- I store all my public code on [Github](https://github.com/joshcanhelp) and find myself on there quite a bit. I open source everything that’s not proprietary or for sale. Thoughts on that [here](/open-source-sale/).
- I try to keep my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcanhelp) as up-to-date as I can.
