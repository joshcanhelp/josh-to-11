<div class="title"><h1>Hi, I’m Josh.</h1><br><h1>Nice to meet you.</h1></div>

I’ve been working on the web since 2007 as an engineer, designer, strategist, user interface consultant, team lead, project manager, and product builder. I’ve been working IRL since 2010 as a husband and since 2013 as a dad.
