## Georgia

> She takes care of us, feeds us ... I like how she tries to match her outfits with Reid ... I like how she teaches me how to sew and teaches her skills to me...She tries to keep the house clean...

## Reid

> She's cute ... and she's so so so nice ... and she's friendly

**Note from dad:** They knew you would want to see a "Lexi dog" on your birthday. Don't worry, I didn't get you a puppy 😁
