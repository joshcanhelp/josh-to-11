# You're Incredible. The End.

Anna, you're my favorite person in the world. You have, in so many ways, inspired me and motivated me and pushed me and helped me understand the world from such a wonderful perspective.

Thankfully, though, this is not the end. In fact so often it feels like just the beginning. The thought that we have decades together seeing the world, moving our bodies, and making things a better place makes the hard parts much easier to handle.

You have put me and our silly, crazy, smart, beautiful kiddos on such a special and unforgettable path. The photos here are just a part of the story. There are so many moments, little and big, that you helped make happen.

Your family and the world are better because you're here. I love you with everything I have and consider us finding each other the best thing that ever happened to me.

### Happy birthday ❤️
