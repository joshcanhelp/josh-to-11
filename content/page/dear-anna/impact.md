# Impact

This one is tough for me to talk about because of the gap between how important it is for you and how important it is for me. This is a place where your inspiration is present but my action has been minimal.

At your core, you are one of the most selfless people that I know. You might forget about that quality of yours when you're dying for some "me time" or internally focused on some perceived personal fault. But I never have, it's one of many things that drew me to you in the first place.

Whether you wanted to be a doctor or a nurse or an LNP or a global health professional, you wanted to help other people. People here and overseas and everywhere in between. Your favorite job (so far) was one that required an immense amount of sympathy for people who you've never met before but who put their lives, in part, in your hands.

We were both working so hard in San Diego but it was clear who had the more noble calling. As I moved from chemistry that would make the world a better place to building websites for strange people, you kept pushing your dreams forward.

From proctored tests in the South of France to thesis defense in California, you kept pushing. Maybe the dream was fuzzy from time to time but there was something inside of you lighting the way. At times, your accomplishments seemed fated, like you were on an unseen yet powerful path. But I think that idea minimizes the effort and commitment that was required to get to where you are now.

Hearing your stories of challenges and frustrations and victories in the NICU was, once again, so inspiring. Your love and care of the tiniest people on the planet along your fierce protective urge for them regularly put me in a state of awe. You worked so hard with such focus in a place where you saw the worst prenatal abuse possible. You tried so hard to fight for these poor kids on such unfortunate paths so early in life. You saved lives, watched others end, and gave everything you had.

There are precious few people who could do that job as well as you did, let alone do it for 6 years. I hope you never forget the personal and emotional sacrifice you made to help so many little people.

Back when I was on-time for this birthday project, I was going to write about how this particular time in your life might have you feeling small and that your impact on the world is minimal. The world at large constantly reminds me of the importance of raising good adults. My dad told me long ago, in response to my lack of desire to have kids based on the state of the world, that it only takes one great person to create incredible positive change. In the thick of it, it's easy to forget about all that.

But, as it turns out, you never did forget. You still gave your time to Adara, leading to the job offer we're now discussing every day. You still guide people you know and ones you don't through the NICU experience. You still talk about paying our good fortune forward to people who need it. You're the same loving, caring, selfless person you've always been.

Thank you. You inspire me to do so much more with my time on the planet.
