This blog has been up since 2008 and, looking back, there were quite a number of posts that were off-topic, unhelpful, out-of-date, or just lame. To keep things clean and truncate the number of pages that were indexed for no good reason, Iâ€™ve removed a few posts from long ago.

You can browse through [all of my posts](/archives/all/) or [all of my tags](/archives/tags/) to find what you need or [search this site on Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ajoshcanhelp.com).
