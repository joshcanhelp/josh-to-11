# This post has been removed

*Thanks for visiting!*

This blog is several years old and, looking back, there were quite a number of posts that were off-topic, unhelpful, out-of-date, or just lame. To keep things clean and truncate the number of pages that were indexed for no good reason, I’ve removed a few posts from long ago.

Theoretically, no one should see this page because I am only removing things that aren’t relevant and aren’t getting traffic. That said, it looks like someone **is** seeing this page so I apologize for robbing you of potentially interesting or helpful content.

Looking for something to read? I have everything organized by topic on [my Learn page](/learn). Enjoy!
