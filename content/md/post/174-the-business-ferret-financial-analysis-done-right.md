# The Business Ferret - Financial Analysis Done Right

Several years in the making, this site was created to explain and generate leads for a financial analysis program created by my dad, Dan Cunningham. He needed to have a site that could explain what The Business Ferret does and gauge interest from the web at large using very targeted keywords. The design was meant to look professional but be a drastic departure from the overly stoic and boring sites that exist in the industry. The product is very unique and we wanted that to be reflected in the look and feel of the site.
