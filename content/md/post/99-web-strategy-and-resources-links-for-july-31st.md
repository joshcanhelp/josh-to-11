# Web strategy and resources links for July 31st

Once again, here are my Friday web strategy links. Lots going on right now and more to report soon but here are a few resources I found particularly relevant to me and what I do. Sometimes in amazing to me that I can even compile a list like this every week but I follow some great people on Twitter and find even more great stuff through Popurls. It’s all about [information reservoirs](/information-reservoirs-or-how-i-keep-track-of-a-large-amount-of-incoming-information/)!

Some big tips and some small tips but some excellent concepts to think about. It’s very easy to get very lost in the buzz of social technology, mobile applications, and new techniques. This article lists some of the basics of website ROI and how to use it to your advantage. Also provides a handy PDF!

I’m working on a web and social media strategy for an animal shelter in Washington state. It’s pro-bono mostly because I believe deeply in what they’re doing but partly because I have a lot to learn about this space. Jason Falls talks about the main things non-profits need to concentrate on to see success online. When I was reading his article, it all sounded like common sense but it defintiely drove the point home. I come back to this article weekly to reinforce what we’re trying to do. For the record, his advice rings true for businesses if you replace “give” with “buy.”

> The three keys to non-profit success, in my opinion, are: 1. Have a compelling story to tell. 2. Make a specific ask or establish a specific goal to reach. 3. Make it astonishingly easy to give.

CSS sprites help your page load much faster by only accessing a single image (like the Google one above) instead of many. This only works for non-repeating images [called as a background](http://w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) in your CSS file. For more info, see [this A List Apart article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites) and [this Smashing Magazine post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/27/the-mystery-of-css-sprites-techniques-tools-and-tutorials/).
