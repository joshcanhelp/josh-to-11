# Create and Submit a Funny Image!

So there’s this meme out there right now that centers around this idea that what you get is not necessarily what you were hoping for; the reality of the situation just somehow didn’t quite match your expectation. Working with Peffley Media, we created a site where you can not only submit images to express your frustration, you can even create your own right on the site. Upload 2 images, one to represent your expectation and one to represent your reality, write a little headline for both, and, voila, you are redeemed (in your own mind at least)! This project uses the PHP GD image library to piece together the images and add text to each. Go ahead and give it a shot, maybe you’ll make the home page!
