# Video and Document Sharing for a Law Firm

This project started out as a fairly straight-forward migration from Joomla to WordPress. Once the new site was laid out and live, we moved on to create three ways for users to engage with Georggin Law. First, we created a video resources page that lists videos straight from their YouTube channel and allows users to select and send videos to colleagues and contacts. The email is branded, includes a personal message, and logs the contact (safely and without an email address) in WordPress. Next, we took that system and created one that uses a WordPress gallery to display legal documents to share and send. Finally, we built out a standard WordPress blog that sends posts to Mailchimp and out to an email list of subscribers. These systems work together to create a simple way for Georggin Law to produce and publish content that gets into the hands of prospective clients.
