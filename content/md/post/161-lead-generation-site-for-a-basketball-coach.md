# Lead generation site for a basketball coach

Jason Jones is a hard-working, dedicated basketball coach here in Seattle who needed a WordPress site to show off his services. Since Jason has been in the game for a while, we wanted to make sure his site represented his professionalism and style of teaching. We used lots of images from a Nike b-ball camp Jason was a part of and he created a great introduction video with a local videographer. The thing Iâ€™m the most proud of, though, is the lead generation form. You can use it as a simple contact form or fill out the remaining fields and send an appointment request to Jason. Slam dunk!
