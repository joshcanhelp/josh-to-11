# Sophie's Arms - Lead Generation and Unit Display for Restored Building

This site was launched in May 2010 to coincide with the release of several completed units in the building. The site displays unit availability and tracks incoming emails based on the units that visitors are interested in. The buildingâ€™s proprietor, Irving Bookspan, wanted a site that conveyed the elegance of his apartment building and was very pleased with the results. The goal was to create a site that made it easy for current and future tenants to find information and show their interest.
