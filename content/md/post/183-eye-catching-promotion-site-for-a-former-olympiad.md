# Eye-catching promotion site for a former Olympiad

Peter Shmock is a former Olympic shot-putter, former fitness trainer for the Seattle Mariners, and co-founder of the Zum gym in Seattle. He also happens to have a very unique and important philosophy on fitness that speaks to people at all points in their life, whether they are a professional athlete or just a person trying to get the most out of life. He calls this philosophy the Life Athlete and, together along with a few more people on his team, we built a site that takes this philosophy and presents it in a very unique way. Before you ask, yes, this is built on WordPress and, yes, I got this job because of nepotism!
