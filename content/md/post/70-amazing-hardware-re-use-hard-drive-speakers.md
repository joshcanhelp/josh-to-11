# Amazing hardware re-use - hard drive speakers

I am always and will forever advocate the reuse of your personal technology. There are times when things need to be replaced/upgraded but I’m all for using what you have if it works.

Along those same lines, I love seeing broken hardware used in creative ways (like this). I have to say, this is one of the most creative uses for an old hard drive that I’ve ever seen. In fact, besides being a nerdy paperweight, I can’t really think of anything else to use an old hard drive for:

Just fantastic…
