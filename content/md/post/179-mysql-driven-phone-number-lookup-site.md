# MySQL-driven Phone Number Lookup Site

I donâ€™t often get a chance to flex a little object-oriented muscle, write queries from scratch, and work outside of the now-very-comfortable WordPress API so I jumped at the opportunity to build this site out. Running on top of several different provided MySQL databases, NumberSleuth displays phone number and location information using a REST-y URL interface and search ability. We incorporated the Google Maps API and some interesting data from Melissa to fill out the various pages. Fun project and more to come on this one soon!
