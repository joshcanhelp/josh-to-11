# AniLOL - just what you'd think

AniLOL.com is an image submission and rating site for – you guessed it – funny animals. There is no shortage of funny animals and certainly no shortage of pictures of them either so why not have one place to find them all? The site is built on Drupal and allows anonymous (and logged in) submission of images that go into a moderation queue before going live. We built in a few cool features like auto-watermarking images, next/previous navigation that circles back around to the beginning, and a random thumbnail generator to keep people clicking. Hey, no one said I had to cure cancer with every site.
