# A Dynamic and Well-Performing WordPress Site for a Popular Seattle Restaurant

Ray’s Boathouse is a Seattle icon that first opened as a coffee shop in 1945. After two major fires in the 80’s and 90’s (almost exactly 10 years apart), they were still going strong and wanted to do a complete re-branding to coincide with a renovation in 2012. Working with Monster Design, we created a gorgeous and easy-to-manage WordPress site to help them run promotions, announce events, manage their menu, and improve how information on their services – catering, hosted events – was displayed. The theme is a completely ground-up custom piece that uses custom post types and core WordPress media attachments to let non-tech-savvy site managers get their job done.
