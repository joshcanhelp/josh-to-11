# Fun, Dynamic, and Easy-to-Manage WordPress Site for a Cloud Storage Company

The talented SmartVault marketing team has no shortage of great ideas to get their product out there but felt that the customer-facing website was holding them back. There are times when a redesign is way overdue and there are times when itâ€™s not even required. SmartVault was right on time. They had outgrown the flat-file site that acted as the top level of their funnel and needed a way to add and modify new resources, marketing tools, and news items.

Together, we created a custom template using simple colors and a few illustrations on top of a custom WordPress back-end. We had many additions in mind when this template was built so it had to be flexible.
