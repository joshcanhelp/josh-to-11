My long relationship with technology started in my early teen years posting on BBSes and building my own computers. After more than a decade of tinkering, I decided to make it my profession by building my first web site in 2006. That first, frustrating site led to more sites, then small clients, then big clients, and finally to a career in digital identity. 

Along the way, I’ve worked with and for companies and agencies both large and small, including Okta, Auth0, Precision Nutrition, 10up, Manning Publications, Alan Colmes, Coca-Cola and Pepsi (at the same time!), Edelman, AT&T Wireless, Johnson & Johnson, and many others.

Here's what is going on [right now](/now/).

## What I'm thinking about

- I'm looking for my next contribution to the [digital identity](/tags/digital-identity) world. I recently [joined IDPro](https://membership.idpro.org/Sys/PublicProfile/72400235) and I want to start contributing articles there. My time in SDKs and marketplace integrations at [Auth0](/tags/auth0) combine to give me a unique experience with IdP integration from two distinct perspectives.
- [Note-taking](/notes/) and personal knowledge bases, like [Obsidian](/tags/obsidian). I take notes daily and collect information I use online in mostly-plain-text files locally. I find this helps greatly to get stuff out of my head, make connections, pick up where I left off, and stay organized.
- [Asynchronous communication](/asynchronous-communication/) is something I think about a lot and have been for a very long time. I'd like to write more about this and maybe start a Substack. I think my experience and perspective on this subject would be helpful to more people than just the ones on my team.
- I've gotten very deep into digital archiving all of my personal documents, photos, [personal data](/tags/personal-data), etc. I'm in the process of figuring out what a low-maintenance system looks like without going too crazy. I'm a bit obsessed with the idea of a simple timeline of my life events and those of my kids. I currently use Day One to collect photos of and letters to my family and I can just export a PDF of all events relating to one kid or the other.
## Where to find me

- I store all my public code on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshcanhelp) and find myself on there quite a bit. I open source everything that’s not proprietary or for sale. Thoughts on that [here](/open-source-sale/).
- I keep my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcanhelp) mostly up-to-date so that serves as my resume for now.
