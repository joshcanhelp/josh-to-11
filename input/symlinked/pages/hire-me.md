# Hire Me

I am currently exploring two options in my professional life:

**I'm looking for a full-time position starting this year.** That's what this page is about. If you came here looking to hire or refer me, you're in the right place! Read on!

**I'm looking for consulting opportunities in identity, data, and app infrastructure.** I'm exploring this with a few colleagues as an option going forward. If you are looking for contracted architecture work with a talented team, see [Nimble SA](https://nimblesa.com)!

Depending on how things go in the remainder of the year, I'll choose one or the other, not both at the same time. Don't worry, I have a life and a family and I want to keep it that way ðŸ˜ƒ

## <span>What I've done</span>

Here are a few projects I've worked on that are relevant to the above. Note that, unless directly indicated, I was part of team for the following projects so what I say that I "designed" something, for example, that means that I either lead the design and had external feedback or I was an integral part of the design, not that I did everything. **Shout out to all the incredible people I've worked with during my career!**
