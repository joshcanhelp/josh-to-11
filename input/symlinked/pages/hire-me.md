# Hire Me

I am a full-stack product engineer and architect who loves working in identity (CIAM focus), data, developer experience, and open source. I thrive in "bridge" roles where I can learn a system or technology and then bring that understanding to others. I've been able to do that in various ways from engineering and team leadership to in-person instruction to partner relations to systems architecture.

## <a id="done"></a><span>What I've done</span>

The following are projects that I've worked on relevant to the skills above. Note that, unless directly indicated, I was part of a team for the following projects so when I say that I "designed" something, for example, that means that I either lead the design and had external feedback or I was an integral part of the design, not that I did everything. **Shout out to all the incredible people I've worked with during my career!**
