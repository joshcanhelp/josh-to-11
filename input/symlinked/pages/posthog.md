I think we're a perfect match! Let me tell you why ... 

I came across **PostHog** when your newest website design got posted on Hacker News in September and got a little tingly feeling. This is the kind of [love and care and weirdness](#love) that I want to put into my work!

> Your homepage makes me so happy, I can hardly put it into words. There is precious little delight and personality and joy in technology these days that when I see it, it jumps out at me. It's a labor of love in a world of optimization. All the little details - the commit history, the window management, the right-click - come together to show real care. 

The delightful design encouraged me to keep digging, and I'm so thankful that I did because I found the thing that made me realize that we were meant for each other: **The Handbook**. Not only do our [values align](#values), the fact that it's all spelled out in detail [means a great deal](#meaning) to me.

> I wrote down my own (engineering-focused) values [last year](/values/), but here are few overlaps that stood out to me.
> 
> - I work hard to build a welcoming environment where people lift each other up at every company I've been at. That creates psychological safety that makes it easier to take chances, risk mistakes, and ship. 
> - Focusing on asynchronous communication and maker schedules is so hard to do without the whole company being aligned on that value. You have to write everything down, be thoughtful about how you're communicating, and put the effort in up front. I'm such a big fan of mindful communication that I pitched [a book about it](/asynchronous-communication/) to a publishing company! 

> [Notes](/notes/) help me clarify my thoughts ([Paul Graham said it best](https://paulgraham.com/words.html)), and [publishing](/posts/) shows commitment to what I'm saying. Teams that put value into writing are more focused, care more about what they're actually producing, and push you to do better (rather than just [more](https://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2021/always-do-extra.php)).

[Since my time at Auth0](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/goodbye-auth0/), I've been looking for a developer-focused, people-first, weird company to pour myself into. The posted job descriptions have character and truly spoke to me. [Genuine builders](#build)  [Grown ups](#adult)  [Optimistic problem solvers](#solve) [Enthusiastic drivers](#drive). It all clicked into place as I found myself whispering *"yes!"* to myself as I read more and more.

> **I'm a genuine builder.** I've built lots of things on my own: a nano-scale software product company ($35K/year, sold for $60K); a [personal data pipeline](/personal-data-pipeline/) (open source, alpha stage); a secure MCP gateway (proof of concept, not quite alpha); an AI visibility dashboard (beta launch this year); a [CLI budgeting tool](/budget-cli/) (open source, powered our family for a couple of years), and lots more smaller things on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshcanhelp?tab=repositories)

> **I'm a grown up.** I really appreciate this phrasing and don't have much to add except you know it when you see it and I smiling the whole time reading your [welcoming environment list](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/grown-ups).

> **I'm an optimistic problem solver.** I think a good indicator here is whether or not someone has burnt out before. I have (thanks COVID) so I know that feeling when things start to get overwhelming and I know what to do when that starts to happen. Making work visible, clear communication in all directions, and breaking things down goes a long way towards restoring sanity.

> **I'm an enthusiastic driver.** I've lead projects of all shapes and sizes, from solo projects (see above) to team-wide products (ask me about SDK telemetry, the Auth0 Marketplace, or guided customer onboarding) to company-wide initiatives (ask me about the Okta VPN deployment or the [Platform One](https://p1.dso.mil) deployment). 

And that's not even including [pineapple on pizza](#pineapple)‼️

> Pineapple absolutely does belong on a pizza, especially with something spicy like jalapeños and something salty like bacon (or bacon of Canadian origin [or both]). This is our favorite pie:

Everything screamed at me "APPLY HERE NOW!" As I was getting my ducks (well, notes) in a row, I saw the final thing that pushed me over the edge. **You're looking for identity experience!** That's my [bread and butter](#butter).

> *Where do I even start?!* I found my love for identity at Auth0, where I started out building SDKs for our consumer identity platform. I taught identity to engineering and tech-adjacent new employees, mentored by the late and truly great [Vittorio Bertucci](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/vittorio/). I wrote an OpenID Connect authorization server liveProject for [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/federation-and-sign-on-ser). I built the federated authentication system for our partner platform. I built and helped partners build SAML integrations for the [Auth0 Marketplace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/features/sso-integrations). I built identity and authorization systems for Department of Defense staff. Most recently, I wrote a proof-of-concept for using an employee identity with agents calling external APIs.

Since Thursday, I've spent a bunch time immersing myself in [everything PostHog](#merch), and I just keeping finding [reasons](#reasons) that we should be together.

> I truly appreciate your interview process. I've [interviewed many people](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/technical-interview/) in the last several years, and a long, drawn-out, overly rigorous process takes up so much time on both ends, and doesn't seem to produce much better results. Hiring is hard, but I appreciate how deliberate and succinct that your process is.

Here's what else I bring to the table:

- I have great discernment about getting to value as fast as possible, whether that's learning, revenue, or customer enjoyment. 
- I have a long history in developer experience, from open source libraries and SDKs to partner integration tools and pro-code. I love working with and for developers, figuring out the best way to get them to fall into the "pit of success."
- I love that your marketing is all content. I love to write (obviously) and I would be so proud of have my words on your website. **Inbound FTW.**

Thank you for reading through this and giving me a chance!

[Random notes](#notes)

> AI was not used in any way to write the words on this page. I tab-accepted some rote DOM JS about 3 times to save key strokes. Writing all this from scratch might be a little *weird* in 2025 ...
> 
> My main language has been TypeScript for a while, and my focus has been on the backend. I've had enough exposure to Python to know that it will be easy for me to pick it up, though. To that end, I started a side project in Django. So far, I really like the list and dictionary haptics as well as the terse syntax!
