I publish new posts there as I have for over a decade and occasionally share articles. I don't log in at all anymore so if you want to comment on something I've written, you can [comment on GitHub](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/josh-to-11/issues/new?assignees=joshcanhelp&labels=comment&template=comment.md&title=Comment+on+joshcanhelp.com) or write me directly at `josh @ this domain`.
