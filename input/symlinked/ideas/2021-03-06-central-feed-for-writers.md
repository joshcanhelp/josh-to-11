title: "Central feed for writers of all kinds"
---

An app, mostly automated, for writers to collect their published works from all sources. 
Allow readers to follow a writer from one source and whatever format they like: RSS, email, etc. Ingests feeds, Twitter, Amazon/GoodReads, author pages on publications, anything. Not a platform for writing like Medium or Ghost, a platform for centralization and discovery. The point would not be to entice writers to write on our platform but to centralize syndication there. Allow lesser-known writers indicate other writers that they are similar to to increase visibility.
