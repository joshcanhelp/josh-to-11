title: "Iâ€™m Stuck: a community to help you find your way out"
---

I find myself in familiar "stuck" places regularly:

- I have free time but don't know what to do with it
- I have too much to do and can't figure out what to do first
- I know what I need to do but I can't start or stay focused
- I'm having trouble letting go of a thought or emotion

In these times, I imagine a yes-no flowchart that helps me rediscover helpful paths I've used before to get unstuck. Essentially a system of reminders based on how I've become unstuck in the past. 

Layer on top of that link aggregation (links to studies or articles that reinforce) and crowd-sourcing (other people can chime in with what helped them, which can be added to your list).
