I've been working on refining how I take, store, and manage notes and tasks. This is, of course, one of those things that feels really important when you're feeling that little bit of pain but, in the grand scheme of things, matters very little. Despite that, I wanted to improve the experience of recording new notes and tasks on my phone to reduce the friction involved in getting a thought out of my head.

Currently, if I want to write something down, I need to:

1. Open the Obsidian app
2. If it's not open already, navigate to the daily note (a note created with the date as the title)
3. Find the place on the note where I need to write
4. Write

This isn't the end of the world but there are a few problems:

- If the note is for a project I'm working on or an addition to a specific reference page I have to do some extra work while writing the note to make that link, either tagging the page or finding the page first.
- If the daily note is brand new, it comes with a template that includes all my current tasks and a few writing prompts. If I'm adding something on the weekend, I feel compelled to delete those out of the note first, which is time-consuming.

Those two things combined makes it unlikely that I'm going to write something down unless it has a severe consequence of some kind. This filters out a lot of things I might write down and never see again, including tasks that maybe just don't need to be done ever. But I'm working towards a more complete record of my life in digital form and being able to quickly get something out of my head feels like a net positive improvement. 

I thought about the ideal user experience for this and it's basically send a text and figure out what to do with it later. I want to get the thing out of my head without worrying about where I put it. If it's something that needs to be moved or dealt it, I want to do that later when I'm on a laptop.
