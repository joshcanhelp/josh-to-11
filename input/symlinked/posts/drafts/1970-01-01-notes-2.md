- [x] Project document system
- [x] Daily update system
- [x] Repo for sample vault, connected to Obsidian but not synced
- [x] Video outline

- What we'll cover:
	- Daily notes and templates
	- Linking
	- Project notes and structure
	- Tags
	- Problems
- What we won't:
	- How we got here (see the post)
	- Community plugins (I don't use any)
	- Personal settings/themes/styling
- Daily notes and templates
	- It all starts here!
	- Lowest possible bar to writing something down
	- Keeps focus on what needs to be done today, not everything
	- Pre-work reminder
	- Reminders/prompts tend to become invisible
- Linking
	- You can actually drive yourself crazy here
	- Linked + unlinked mentions (core plugins)
- Project notes and structure
	- Big unlock for me
	- Great to be able to review past projects + accomplishments
	- Quarterly review, interviews, etc
- Tags
	- Use them somewhat
	- Lightweight grouping for paragraphs and bullet points
	- Have to decide between a tag and a page
- Text archiving
	- Articles/reading
	- References
	- This can also chip away at your sanity
- Problems
	- Quickly adding TODOs and notes on mobile
		- Tried a few plugins, nothing quite right
		- Would love to text a certain number and have it show up in a certain place
	- Storage in other systems (Confluence, etc)
		- Solution: drafts and personal notes only in Obsidian
	- Other data storage (Day One, Strava, Oura, etc)
		- Would like to take data for all days together
		- Currently sync Oura data to daily note but it's manual
		- Also export Day One to text but, again, manual
		- Also search
		- Thinking about it ...
