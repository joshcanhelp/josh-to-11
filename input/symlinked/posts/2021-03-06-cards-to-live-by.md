One day last November, I tried to build a morning ritual I could stick to. Nothing crazy, just a handful of things I wanted to do each day like drink a big glass of water, stretch, meditate, take vitamins, acting like an adult. One of the things on that list was to review a list of phrases I wanted to keep in mind throughout the day. 

![Index cards with mantras](/_images/2021/02/cards_to_live_by.jpg)

I would read each card, let it sit with me for a few seconds, put a little dot on it if it resonated and then move onto the next. 

It ended up being an important mental exercise during the isolated, cold, and wet holiday season. I would find myself just running through them as one more thing to get through, then pause, remember why I'm spending the time, and start over. When parenting or meditating or just trying to exist in the world during an uncertain time, one of these phrases would often bubble up and provide some calm. 

In the hopes of inspiring someone else to do the same, I thought I'd share the phrases here, along with where they came from and what they mean to me. [You can see these in presentation form here](/cards).

**Here are cards that I have used previously:**

## One team,<br>One score,<br>Everywhere


I cribbed this from [Auth0's values](https://auth0.com/careers/culture) but it applies to much more than work:

> Team success always outweighs individual accomplishments, and we celebrate both.

I think about this in the context of my marriage (her accomplishments are mine and vice versa), our family (our kids' success is ours as well), our neighborhood, our school ... everywhere. Putting the success of the people around you at the same level as, or higher than, your own pays dividends.

## Your current habits<br>deliver your current results


This came from a great interview of James Clear by Sam Harris ([my notes here](/improvement-as-experimentation/#2020-11-24)) and it's so simple but so easy to forget. Everything about our life, good or bad, is due mostly to what we do in response to stimuli over and over. Basing changes in your life on "trying harder" is not a strategy for success. Change your habits, change your life.

## Observe the thought and let it pass.<br>Where does it go?


Take a minute to ask yourself: what is a thought? When you are lost in thought, what is that experience? What are you aware of during that time?

For me, thoughts are images combined with lots of words, typically in my voice. This slideshow can be mesmerizing but I can also become aware of it, see it for what it is (images and words), and it kind of just .... melts away. This is my reminder that this exercise is possible.

## Begin again,<br>in this moment

No matter what you're doing or where you are mentally, you can start over right now. You can put the phone down and plug in. You can pick that project back up. You can re-commit to what you're doing right now, even if you've been distracted for the last 5, 10, or 30 minutes. Regardless of how much time you have left, regardless of how much time you already spent distracted. 

Apply the [sunk cost fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tyMdPwd8x2RygcheE/sunk-cost-fallacy) to time and don't let poor past performance ruin what's possible next.

## There is no such thing as free will

Everything you think and do is a product of countless external influences, the condition of your experience at the time, and a life of experiences leading up to this moment. This moment is the effect of myriad causes outside of your control. How is it possible to look back and regret anything?

[Here's an essay that goes into more detail about this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/).<br>

## Boredom is a lack of attention

The next time you're bored, pay attention to that feeling. What is happening in your body and mind when you're bored? I find that it's often when I'm doing one thing but want to do another and can't. Or maybe I keep doing something (scrolling through Twitter, for instance) because I'm avoiding thoughts about something else. The boredom is always less about what I'm actually doing than where my head is currently located.

## The kids are never wrong

I read this in [Astrid the Unstoppable](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/591752/astrid-the-unstoppable-by-maria-parr/) and it rang so clear and true. How could a child be wrong about how they feel? How could they be wrong in sharing their experience? How could they be wrong when expressing themselves? 

It's too easy to fall into the trap of gaslighting your kids, protecting your ego at their expense. You're the adult; act like it.

## We don’t have to take responsibility for how someone feels

Because someone is having a bad reaction to you or something you did does not make you directly responsible for that reaction. You might have triggered anger or sadness or anxiety in someone but they have their own responsibility for containing and dealing with emotions that arise.

Taking ownership for your own actions does not directly correlate to fixing how someone feels. You do not choose or control how someone will react to what you do. People have been shot for driving too slow. 

## Solve problems together

Letting other people - children, teammates, partners - find solutions for a shared problem gives them ownership over the outcome and experience solving problems. Handing a solution to someone might be the fastest way to alleviate the immediate pain that the problem is causing but it's not always the best overall outcome. 

Oh and ... you're not so amazing that you always have the best solution. 

## Let them help

Kids learn by doing and need our guidance to know what to do around the house. Chores, work, repairs, anything new should involve any kid that is interested in it It might take longer and require cleanup but the kids will benefit.

## Aim for simplicity


Less words.

Less features.

Less UI.

## Share work early

Don't be scared to get your words or code or anything else out there into the world, particularly with people you're collaborting with. Sell your idea before you get attached. Get feedback as early as possible.

## What is the job to be done?

What is the one thing that your creation needs to do? If it's a blog post, what is the main thing that you're teaching or announcing? If it's an app, what's the one thing that users need to achieve using it? Put your goal into words and come back to them regularly so you don't miss the mark or do too much.
