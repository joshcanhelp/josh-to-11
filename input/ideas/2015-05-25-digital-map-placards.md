title: "Digital map placards"
---

Leave public notes at specific latitude/longitudes via a mobile app. When you have the app turned to "Discovery," it vibrates when it gets near a placard or groups of placards. You can set the distance around you to pick up more or less. Placards could contain personal memories ("proposed to my partner here") or facts and be attributed to someone or anonymous.
