title: "Cards to Live By"
---

An app to build decks of reminder cards that can be reviewed as part of a morning routine, [like these](/cards). There is a master deck that can be reviewed in order or shuffled. Cards can be placed into tags/categories for specific decks. Font and color choice, maybe more for premium. Add the ability to tap a card if it resonates particularly well, both for your own cards and others. [More context here](/cards-to-live-by).
