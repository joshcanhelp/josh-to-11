An app, mostly automated, for writers to collect their published works from all sources. 
Allow readers to follow a writer from one source and whatever format they like: RSS, email, 
etc. Injests feeds, Twitter, Amazon/GoodReads, author pages on publications, anything. Not
a platform for writing, a platform for centralization and discovery. The point would not be 
to intice writers to write on our platform but to centralize syndication there. Allow 
lesser-known writers indicate other writers that they are similar to to incerase visbility.
