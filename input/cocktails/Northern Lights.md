The original recipe called for "homemade or the highest quality" cranberry sauce for this recipe. Instead, I used Ocean Spray jellied cranberry sauce to give the opposite end of the spectrum a shot. It turned out just fine but I would recommend whisking the sauce with the non-sparkling ingredients for a bit first so you don't have any chunks.

- 1 oz [[Gin]]
- 0.5 oz simple syrup
- 0.5 oz lemon juice
- ~2 teaspoons cranberry sauce
- 2 dashes Angostura
- 2 oz [[Sparkling Wine]]

**Steps:**

1. Shake everything except wine with ice and strain into flute
2. Top with wine
