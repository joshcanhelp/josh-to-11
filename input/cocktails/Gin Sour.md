This is best, IMHO, with [Empress Gin](https://www.empressgin.com). The gorgeous striation is made by floating the colorful spirit on top, which means your first few sips are straight gin and the last few straight lemonade. Gaze upon your work for a few moments, then stir and enjoy.

- 2 oz [[Gin]]
- 0.75 oz lemon juice 
- 0.75 oz simple syrup
- Optional: 2-4 dashes lavender bitters

**Steps:**
 
 If just using regular gin, shake everything up with ice and strain into a glass.
 
 If using Empress:
 
1. Shake the lemon juice, simple syrup, and bitters with ice and strain into a rocks glass.
2. Add crushed ice to the top
3. Pour the gin slowly over the top of the ice
