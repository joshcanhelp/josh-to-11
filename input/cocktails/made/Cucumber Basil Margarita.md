This works great with tequila or mezcal. The recipe below could easily make two smaller cocktails, just depends on how the day went for you.

- 1/4 cup cucumber, peeled and chopped into ~0.25" cubes
- 6 fresh basil leaves
* 1 oz lime juice
* 3 oz  [[Mezcal]] or [[Tequila]]
* 0.75 oz agave or simple syrup
* Pinch of salt

**Steps:**

1. Muddle cucumber, basil, and lime juice in a cocktail shaker for ~20 seconds
2. Add mezcal or tequila and shake for ~20 seconds
3. Pour contents through a strainer into a non-serving glass
4. Rinse the shaker and pour the cocktail back in
5. Add agave syrup and salt and swirl to mix; taste to make sure it's the right sweetness
6. Add ice and shake for ~30 seconds, then strain into serving glasses
