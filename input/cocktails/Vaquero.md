I'll just come out and say it: this is my favorite cocktail. It's time-consuming and requires a crazy number of ingredients but, damn, it's a great one. No surprise, though, given that the spirits are 3 of my favorites.

* 1.5 ounces [[Bourbon]]
* 0.75 ounce lemon juice
* 0.75 ounce [[Ancho Reyes]]
* 0.5 ounce [[Aperol]]
* 0.25 ounce 1:1 Demerara or simple syrup
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters
* 2 pineapple chunks, muddled
* 1 sage leaf, muddled

**Steps:**

1. Add the pineapple chunks and sage leaf to a mixing tin and muddle.
1. Add remaining ingredients to the tin and shake.
1. Fine strain into a coupe glass and garnish with a sage leaf.
