An Old Fashioned is not a precise drink and it's to your taste. Try this ratio and 2 dashes of bitters and see if you like it. The balance between sweet, alcohol, and aromatics should just feel right when you get it. I prefer these stirred with ice and served up but over ice is another way to do it.

* 2 oz [[Bourbon]]
* 0.5 oz simple syrup
* 2-4 dashes Angostura

**Steps:**

1. Add ingredients and swirl the mixture in a shaker, then take a small taste. It should be strong (the ice will water it down) but balanced. You should be able to taste the bitters but the drink should not be bitter. Adjust as desired.
2. Fill the shaker past the liquid with ice and immediately start stirring; stir for exactly 20 rotations.
3. Immediately strain into a rocks glass.
