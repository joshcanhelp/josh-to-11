# Experience The World
We've been talking a lot about our values and I can safely say that experiencing the world is high up on that list.

My mom travelled a bit and I, in a general sense, knew that there was more out there but it was you that introduced me to this idea in a big and important way. Hearing your stories about France and Cambodia and Kenya as we were getting to know each other sparked something in me. I wanted to see more than just our neighboring countries and I wanted to see them with you.

You have a wonderful sense of adventure that has served you well throughout your life. You seem to have no fear when it comes to new experiences (as long as you're not the center of attention while it's happening). I knew, when we were talking about your adventures, that I would be playing catch-up for a long time.

Our first trip together was a great introduction to traveling with you. There weren't any special requirements or hang-ups or hesitations. You were there for the experience and there was not much that could ruin it.

I remember a lot of simple pleasures on that trip. The impossibly orange yolk of the eggs we ate on the patio and a whole day reading in the same place. The warmth of the ocean and the sound of the waves crashing with hardly anyone around. A cold beer in a heavy, thick bottle. To have someone that appreciates those small things for what they are is a gift beyond measure.

But that was nothing compared to our time in Europe.
I remember distinctly getting into the train station in Paris and feeling totally out-of-sorts. The language was barely familiar and we were so far from home. But you were there and you had been through it before so I knew it would be OK.

Hearing you tell stories about your adventures through Europe while we walked kilometer after kilometer through Paris made it feel a little bit like we were home. You were tireless and gorgeous and courageous and the best guide and partner anyone could ask for. It made me want to sell all of our things and stay there with you forever.

But, of course, that couldn't happen. You had other places to show me.

Different parts of the world calling your name.

And food that could not be denied.

You have taught me so much about how to live but maybe the most important lesson has been how to experience the world. To think that I might not ever have gotten the urge to see far away places is a terrible thought. All the sites unseen and food uneaten. It would have been a sad existence, indeed.

Thank you. My life will never be the same because of you.
