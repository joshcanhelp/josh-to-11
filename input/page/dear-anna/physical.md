# Move Your Body

I think this value is so underrated and an easy one to exclude from the list. But it contributes so much to life, especially when combined with the others (remember biking through Paris?).

This is one of my favorite pictures of you, maybe one of my favorite of all time. It serves as a reminder of your power and capability as a human. This photo is just a moment in time and only a fraction of what is possible for you.

Watching you get up early to swim, tighten up your running shoes to attack Discovery Park, coming back sweaty and dirty with a huge smile on your face ... I was so proud of you. And so inspired.

If anyone is going to keep us moving, it's you. We have our more active times and less active times but it seems like exercise and movement is part of your DNA. I know if there's a ride or a race or a climb or a hike, you'll join me. And you'll effortlessly keep up or beat me to the finish line.

The impact of your natural attraction towards physical activity is felt all over our lives. From Georgie talking about "running a race" with you to Reid wanting to "play tennis," our whole family has benefitted from your commitment. Maybe we could bike a little more and maybe we could make it to the gym more often but I know that you'll be the one keeping us from slipping too far.

When we ran our first race together, I was so proud of myself but, even more than that, I was so thankful to have you in my life to inspire me like you do. I love talking about future cross-country biking trips that we'll do together and Ironman races that I'll cheer for you on from the sidelines.

Thank you. I'll be a healthy, happier, and longer-lasting person because of you.
