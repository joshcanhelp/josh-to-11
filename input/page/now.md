Oh man ... now. Now is weird and hard. 

Professionally, things are good. I'm on a new team at Auth0 working on the core platform which has been great. Tons of learning and building and designing and product thinking. It's been tough to mov away from open source and our community but also refreshing as well. I've been doing support professionally in some form for 2 decades at this point, it's time for a break. 

Besides the occasion support request, my time working with WordPress has concluded. This blog is [now on Eleventy](/taking-wordpress-to-eleventy/), I don't do any freelance work, and my work at Auth0 is primarily focused on Node and React. It's been a relief to leave all my WordPress ideas in the past (though I'm working on one final post about WordPress testing that I'll get out soon).

Personally ... well, we have kids and there is a pandemic. If you're in the same boat, then you know **exactly** what my life looks like. If you're not and would like to imagine what it's like to suddenly take on teaching a first grader, [I just published a post about it](/how-we-are-teaching-right-now/).

I've been writing a lot, both in a journal and on a blog. I take a lot of phone photos lately and have been adding old journal entries as a timeline both for myself and our kids. I'm almost at 1,000 entries in my Day One journal at this point. I've been playing around with Roam Research and trying to just get words out of me. It's been very theraputic. 

I miss the gym and breweries and breaks from the kids and eating out with my wife and friends and family and the library and so so many things. We're doing our part with once-weekly grocery trips, wearing masks, and staying isolated. We've had some really great bonding time together, though, and are able to stay employed doing jobs we love and are challenged by. It's hard but it could be worse.

> After reducing all of the professional clutter – trading it in for a “real job” I’m quite fond of – I started concentrating on the material and digital clutter around me. I’ve gotten rid of around half of the stuff I used to keep in my office and I’ll do another half more before the year is out. If this form of obsession appeals to you, I’d recommend [Marie Kondo’s first book](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1).

> I’m walking less, cycling more, and spending even more time with my family. We now live on Bainbridge Island now, a 35m ferry ride from downtown Seattle. It’s green, it’s quiet, and it’s exactly what we all needed. I miss easy access to Seattle family and friends, city bike rides, and great breweries but not traffic, noise, bridges, or owning a house.

> I’m working less with WordPress and more with [vanilla PHP](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/auth0-php-test) and [Node](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/repos-to-csv). I’m also picking up [Ruby](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/auth0-ruby-basic), writing [tons of documentation](https://github.com/auth0/docs/commits/master?author=joshcanhelp), and [solving](https://wordpress.org/support/users/auth0josh/) [problems](https://community.auth0.com/u/josh.cunningham/summary). I miss SCSS and UI/UX but not SEO, analytics, or PhotoShop.

> Right now my focus is paring down. I sold my WP product business … not taking on any new client projects … archived most of the things I had on my list to work on.
>
> I’m reading more, walking more, and spending more time with my family.
>
> I’m also focusing on a single client right now which gives me the headspace to produce better work.
