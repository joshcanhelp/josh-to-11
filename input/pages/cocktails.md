I don't love cooking but I love making cocktails (and mocktails) for myself and those around me. Over time, I've gathered a bunch of recipes from different places, modified them to my liking (or not), and kept track of the recipe. The two sections below are ones I've made and enjoyed on top and the ones that look good on the bottom.

General rules for making cocktails:

- When a recipe calls for citrus juice of some kind, *always* squeeze it fresh.
- Anything with citrus is shaken, anything without is stirred.
- Shake 20 times or less; stir for 20 revolutions or less. Stop when the shaker is freezing cold.
- If you're making something for the first time, try it before you shake and adjust.
