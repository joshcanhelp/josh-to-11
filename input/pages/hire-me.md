# Hire Me!

I am a full-stack product engineer and architect who loves working in identity (CIAM focus), data, developer experience, and open source. I thrive in "bridge" roles where I can learn a system or technology and then bring that understanding to others. I've been able to do that in various ways from engineering and team leadership to in-person instruction to partner relations to systems architecture.

## <a id="want"></a><span>What I'm looking for</span>
I like to work with people who push me to learn and grow while providing strong
psychological safety. I like teams that take the time to get to know each other a bit and solve hard technical problems together.

Roles that would probably be a good fit for me:

- Partner engineering/architecture
- Full-stack or backend product engineering/architecture
- Solution engineering/architecture
- Engineering management
- Technical product management

I would like to continue to work with identity, security, and authentication/authorization, ideally for a company building products for developers. That said, my main focus is finding a great team where I can do my best work!

### Who You Are

- Put actual work into your company values, company culture, and diversity
- 80% - 100% remote (maximum two days per week in a Seattle office, occasional offsites are welcome)
- Net-neutral or better impact on the world (not interested in ad tech, social networks, user surveillance, or AI replacing humans)

### Bonus points

- Working on decentralized technology
- Sponsoring or maintaining open source software
- Opportunity to learn another programming language
- Contribution to the IETF, W3C or another web standards organization

## <a id="done"></a><span>What I've done</span>

The following are projects that I've worked on relevant to the skills above. Note that, unless directly indicated, I was part of a team for the following projects so when I say that I "designed" something, for example, that means that I either lead the design and had external feedback or I was an integral part of the design, not that I did everything. **Shout out to all the incredible people I've worked with during my career!**
