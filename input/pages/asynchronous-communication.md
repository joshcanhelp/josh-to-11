I've been maintaining this list privately for a while but wanted to get it out in the world to potentially spark some collaboration, communication, and [writing](/tag/async-communication/). Who knows?

## Why does this need to be considered?
- Asynchronous communication is primarily written communication ([The Future of Work is Written](https://increment.com/remote/future-of-work-is-written/)) but goes beyond that
	- Audio
	- Video
	- Diagrams
	- Emojis
- Extra time spent communicating can feel like wasted time
	- taken to the extreme, 100% communication or 100% building would not achieve the right things
- Introvert types can shine as async communicators, taking pressure off of them during face-to-face meetings
- Communication happens in places we expect AND everywhere in between
- The right amount of extra time spent on async communications can save tons of time on the long tail and meetings as well
- Makes a record that can be found later; this can be done well or poorly
- Asynchronous communication across cultures, groups, teams needs to take the tone-free nature of async written communication into account.
- The most challenging part of the transition to remote work is changes to how we communicate

- David McCullough’s beautiful words:
	- *To write is to think, and to write well is to think well.*
- "Intellectual detritus" is valuable if it can be referenced and re-used
	- [David Perrell on Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/196-david-perell)
	- ["producing artifacts"](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing)
- Everlasting problems
	- How to record decisions
	- How to record artifact data
	- How to avoid rot
	- How to avoid overload

## The goal (aka Doing It Right)

- improve understanding within the team and without; have a clear place to point common questions
- allow team members to unfocus from communication channels for periods of time; mile markers with a clear indication of where a certain decision process is at
- balance of recording time versus retrieval time; save versus search
- foster a bias for action

## Notes

- This was written in a specific year with specific technologies; try to abstract to what's current and what's likely to stick around for a while
- Try to think about tools not as a specific software but what what that tool enables and how it's typically used; the techniques here are how to use those systems better
    - Many short messages with an expectation of a short turn-around time (Slack)
    - Longer messages with a longer turn around time (email)
- Want to provide advice for folks working in a great environment, as well as folks working in not-so-great ones; good communication can happen anywhere
- This was written by a software person but the lessons and techniques are applicable anywhere; asynchronous communication is important in almost every job and only increasing as remote work does
- This is not meant to make you paranoid or overly cautious when communicating; these techniques will help you avoid mistakes that are invisible and, with practice, they become second-nature; make the invisible visible
- There are great lessons to be learned from marketers and copywriters but this book is about effective teamwork, not promotion
- This is not about some vague idea of professionalism. I’m not going to tell you to watch your punctuation during a chat or not to use emoji or any other number of cultural things you’ll need to navigate on your own. I want you to say enough, but not too much, to the right people using the best format to accomplish what you want to get done.

## Consider: Audience

- Everyone
    - Clarity and simplicity
    - Storytelling
        - https://www.google.com/search?q=storytelling+brain
        - use cases
        - user stories
    - Metaphors, analogies, examples
        - [David Perrell on Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/196-david-perell)
- Specialist to specialist
    - Code reviews
    - In-code documentation
    - Jargon, short cuts
    - Watch for inclusive language
        - Camile Fournier on explanation ...
- Specialist to leadership
    - May or may not understand the technical details **and don't want to**
- Specialist to specialist-adjacent
    - May or may not understand the technical details **but need to**
- Specialist to non-specialist
    - Technical details are irrelevant
- Combination/mixed

## Consider: Purpose/JTBD

- Exploration/Discovery
- Planning support
- Record keeping/event documenation
    - Meeting notes
    - Incident responses
    - Retroactives
- News/announcements
- Response needed
- Instructional
    - https://documentation.divio.com
        - Tutorials - learning
        - How-To - problem
        - Explanation - understanding
        - Reference - information
- Visibility

## Consider: In-between

- hierarchical relationship between participants
    - Bi-directional
    - Thoughtful responses from "higher ups" says a lot
- people still try to read tone here
    - Thanks for the Feedback: leaky things
- who is included can be a signal
    - Meeting invite list
    - Credits and thank yous
    - List of authors
- how long it took to respond (or any response at all)
    - Sometimes a quick acknowledgement is enough
    - Not responding could be a clear message, intensional or not
- how short/long the response is
    - If I ask 3 questions and you answer 1, how does that look?
    - Conversely, if I ask the CTO 3 questions I could have Googled, how does that look?
- what was said is clear, what was meant is missing
- how in-depth the document goes; length
    - Maybe it needs to be long, maybe not
- how much communication is happening at the time
    - Asking for a document review on a Friday after 2 incidents ...
- specific word choices
    - Inclusive language
- day or time sent
    - Sunday morning Slack message from VPs ...
- metadata like title, tags, etc
- visibility

## Techniques**

    - First drafts
    - Bain dumps

    - [line by line, sentence by sentence](https://www.copyblogger.com/bukowski-immortal-writing/)
    - what’s the ROI of the next re-read?
    - what’s the desired outcome?

    - Take inventory
    - Re-read in context

- Polls/Surveys
- Repetition
    - Don't take it personally
- Due dates
- Asking for feedback
    - There is nothing wrong with asking for help!
- Over-explain; teach

- Formatting
    - Headlines for scanning and linking
    - Ordered lists for in-order steps
    - Unordered lists for options
    - Code format for machine names
    - Bold for specific labels
