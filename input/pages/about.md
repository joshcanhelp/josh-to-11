My long relationship with technology started in my early teen years posting on BBSes and building my own computers. After more than a decade of tinkering, I decided to make it my profession by building my first web site for a family member in 2006. Soon after that, I started taking on small client projects found via word-of-mouth and online-networking while completing a B.S. in Chemistry. Since then, I’ve built Josh Can Help up to a thriving freelance practice that supported me and my family from 2008 until 2018 when I joined **[Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/authors/josh-cunningham/)**. 

I’ve worked with and for companies and agencies both large and small, including Auth0, Precision Nutrition, 10up, Manning Publications, Alan Colmes, Coca-Cola and Pepsi (at the same time!), Edelman, AT&T Wireless, Johnson & Johnson, and many others. I am currently employed full time and not looking for new jobs or consulting opportunities. 

I truly enjoy working on and with the web and I’ve met so many interesting, talented people along the way. I believe that you’re only as good as the people you associate with so I try to stay connected to people who I admire and enjoy spending time with. I also love helping people do their best online and elsewhere, hence the name of this site and my online persona.

Here's what is going on [right now](/now/).

## What I'm thinking about

- [Asynchronous communication](/asynchronous-communication/) is something I think about a lot and have been for a very long time. I'd like to write more about this and maybe start a Substack. I think my experience and perspective on this subject would be helpful to more people than just the ones on my team.
- I've gotten very deep into digital archiving all of my personal documents, photos, data, etc. I'm in the process of figuring out what a low-maintenance system looks like without going too crazy. I'm a bit obsessed with the idea of a simple timeline of my life events and those of my kids. I currently use Day One to collect photos of and letters to my family and I can just export a PDF of all events relating to one kid or the other. 
- [Note-taking](/notes/) and personal knowledge bases. I take notes daily and collect information I use online in mostly-plain-text files locally. I find this helps greatly to get stuff out of my head, make connections, pick up where I left off, and stay organized.
- [Writing and publishing](/tag/writing-publishing/) online, especially in the context of being a note-taker. I journal, blog and take notes and, for the most part, I have a system that works. But there is a lot of writing I do locally that doesn't make it online. I'd like to scoot my note-taking a little closer to both my public and private writing. I'd like to write more about and contribute to [Eleventy](/tag/eleventy/), the software I use for this site.
- [Personal development](/tag/personal-development/) has always been important to me and I'm still working hard to get a little closer to being a person my wife and kids can be proud of.

## Where to find me

- The best way to contact me is via email at `josh [at] joshcanhelp [dot] com`. 
- I store all my public code on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshcanhelp) and find myself on there quite a bit. I open source everything that’s not proprietary or for sale. Thoughts on that [here](/open-source-sale/).
- I keep my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcanhelp) mostly up-to-date so that serves as my resume for now.
- I am "on Twitter" [@joshcanhelp](https://twitter.com/joshcanhelp) ... sort of ... [more on that here](/tag/twitter/).
- You san see a feed of changes to my site [on GitHub here](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/josh-to-11/commits/master). If you star or watch that repo it can function as somewhat of a subscription here.
