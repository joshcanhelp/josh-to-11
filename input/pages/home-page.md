<div class="title"><h1>Hi, I’m Josh.</h1><br><h1>Nice to meet you.</h1></div>

I’ve been working on the web since 2007 as an architect, engineer, writer, designer, strategist, user interface consultant, team lead, project manager, and product builder. I’ve been working IRL since 2010 as a husband and since 2013 as a dad. I like riding bikes, reading books, writing code and words, and eating good food.
